# Simple Responsive Landing Page (HTML + CSS)

This starter meets the internship task requirements:

- **Files:** `index.html`, `style.css`
- **Layout:** Header with logo + nav (Flexbox), hero section with heading, paragraph, and CTA button, features grid, and footer
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first styles with media queries; CSS-only hamburger menu collapse
- **No build tools:** Just open `index.html` in a browser or with VS Code Live Server

## How to run

1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open `index.html` directly in a browser (or use the VS Code Live Server extension).

You can now replace content, colors, and links as needed.
